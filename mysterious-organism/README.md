This is a project that mimicks how an unknown fiction organism could behave.

It is programmed with JavaScript with a factory function that creates organisms on demand.
This factory function has several methods that replicate mutation, allows the research team to compare samples or predict the survability of a target sample.

The code ends returning an array of a working sample of 30 organisms as JavaScript objects to work with.
