This is a project that mimics how an unknown fictional organism could behave.

It is programmed with JavaScript and has a factory function that creates organisms on demand.
This factory function has several methods that replicate mutation, allowing the research team to compare samples or predict the survivability of a target sample.

The code returns an array of a working sample of 30 organisms as JavaScript objects to work with.
